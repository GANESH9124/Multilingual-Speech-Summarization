# Multilingual Speech Recognition and Summarization Model

This project focuses on building a multilingual speech recognition and summarization model by integrating OpenAI's Whisper Large V3 model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system is designed to take audio or video inputs, transcribe and summarize the content, store the results in a vector database using FAISS, and respond to user queries based on the stored content.

## Overview

This project enables real-time or batch processing of audio or video files for multilingual transcription and summarization. The system uses Whisper Large V3 for robust speech recognition across various languages and RAG for generating responses based on the stored information in a vector database.

### Key Components:
1. **Whisper Large V3**: A state-of-the-art speech recognition model that supports multilingual transcription.
2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: A model that retrieves relevant information from a database and generates responses to user queries.
3. **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**: A vector database for storing and efficiently retrieving the transcribed and summarized content.

## Features

- **Multilingual Speech Recognition**: Supports multiple languages for transcription.
- **Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of transcribed content.
- **Vector Database Storage**: Stores transcriptions and summaries in a FAISS vector database for fast retrieval.
- **Query-based Response**: Responds to user queries using RAG by retrieving relevant information from the vector database.
